# CLAUDE.md — `<Project Name>` Docs

Static Nextra documentation site (Next.js App Router, MDX, `output: 'export'`). No backend, no
database, no auth, no test suite. Content lives under `content/` (`.mdx` pages plus `_meta.js` nav
files), a thin `app/` shell renders it through Nextra's catch-all route, and `components/` holds the
few `.tsx` files the theme cannot express. `scripts/generate/docs/` and `scripts/generate/changelog/`
write MDX from source comments and git history: **never hand-edit their output.**

> **There is deliberately no `AGENTS.md` and no `SSOT.md` here.** `SSOT.md` states what a codebase
> _is_; a docs site renders content another repository owns. `AGENTS.md` guards domain logic, and
> there is none. This file, `.claude/rules/` and the hooks carry the rule layer. A content pipeline
> that grows conventions worth numbering is the signal to add `AGENTS.md`, and not before.

## Orientation

Before a non-trivial change, skim:

- `content/_meta.js` and each section's `_meta.js`: the real navigation
- `app/layout.tsx`: theme, navbar, footer, metadata
- `next.config.mjs`: the Nextra wrapper and the static export
- `.claude/anti-patterns/INDEX.md`: known traps. Read it **before** touching the `nextra` /
  `nextra-theme-docs` versions or the dev and build scripts, not after the build breaks

## Agent Tooling

- **Command wrapper.** If shell commands go through a wrapper (an output filter, a sandbox, a
  recorder), declare it here as a hard rule, prefix every command in this file with it, and list it
  under `commandWrappers` in `.claude/agent-config.json` so the safety hook judges the command it
  wraps. A wrapper mentioned in passing is dropped once a task gets busy. With no wrapper, the
  commands here are already correct.
- **Library APIs:** check current docs through Context7 before relying on training data.
- **Serena:** call `mcp__serena__initial_instructions` before the first symbol search, then use its
  symbol tools for `.ts`/`.tsx` and the built-in tools for MDX and everything else. If it is not
  connected, say so once and use the built-in tools.

## Quality Gates

Before calling a task done, run `bash scripts/check/gates.sh`. It runs `scripts/check/gates.list`,
the list `.husky/pre-commit` runs, and prints each gate's exit code and log. In a shared checkout,
`--paths <your files>` limits format and lint to your own files, and `--fix <your files>` formats
them. It includes the hook probes, about nine minutes, and so does a commit that stages a hook,
`.claude/settings.json`, the probes, `scripts/ops/unlock.sh` or `scripts/env/`: give either Bash
call the full 600000 ms timeout, or the tool stops it at two minutes.

`bun run build` (never `bun build`) is not a gate; run it after a structural change and before a
PR. There is no test suite: do not invent `bun test` commands. `bun run docs:generate` and
`bun run changelog:generate` rebuild the generated pages; re-run them when their source or the git
history changed, then review the generated MDX.

No explicit `any` and no `as unknown as` in `.ts`/`.tsx`: `.claude/rules/typescript/types.md` says
what to use instead.

## Commit Format

```text
type(scope): subject, at most 50 characters

[optional body, wrapped at ~72 chars]
```

Types: `feat` · `fix` · `refactor` · `chore` · `docs` · `style` · `perf`. They label commits, not
branches (see § Branching). Scope is the area touched (`product`, `technical`, `nav`, `scripts`).
Commit by pathspec (`git commit -- <paths>`), after `git add` for new files only. `git add -A` is
used only inside `/ship`, which states its own guards; everything else, `/checkpoint` included,
names its files.

## Branching

| Branch             | Purpose                                              |
| ------------------ | ---------------------------------------------------- |
| `internal/{scope}` | Experiments, proof of concept, early work on a scope |
| `dev`              | Active development: every scope merges here first    |
| `prod`             | Stable, deployed                                     |

`internal/{scope}/{context}` splits a scope into parallel tasks; `internal/{scope}` then becomes
their integration branch and takes no direct commits. Merge order: `internal/{scope}/{context}` →
`internal/{scope}` → `dev` → `prod`, by pull request, merged with `--merge`. The safety hook refuses
pushes to `dev`, `prod`, `main` and `master`: hand such a push to the user to run with `!`.

## Protected Files

- `.env*`, except `.env.<target>.example` (the schema, with no real values). The hooks refuse every
  shell read or write of one. List a file with `bash scripts/env/show.sh <file>` (secrets masked); a
  value changes only through `scripts/env/set.sh`, while the user has unlocked `env` themselves
  (`docs/unlock.md`). Never run the unlock yourself: ask the user to.
- Generated pages: change their source and re-run the generator. `generated-guard.sh` refuses hand
  edits to the paths `.claude/agent-config.json` lists under `generatedPaths`.
- `.claude/settings.json` holds the permissions and the hook wiring: change it only when the user
  asks, and never to get past a refusal.

## Workflow Commands

Slash commands live in `.claude/commands/`, mirrored from `_workflow-source/` by
`bash scripts/sync/workflows.sh`: **edit the source, never a mirror.** Its `--check` mode verifies
without writing and is the one CI runs. `.claude/commands/INDEX.md` lists every command. Reach for
`/rca` on a bug (reproduce first) and `/ship` to review, gate, commit and push the work branch.

## On-demand References

Nothing below loads automatically: read a file when its row matches the task. The first four
files ship as `.claude/<NAME>.example.md` templates: fill one in and drop `.example`, or delete the
template and its row.
